Assignment 7 for Information Visualization (CS465): Interactive text fingerprints of uploaded txt files of books giving information of how a document is written. 

Each square block represents 200 words of text and is colored according to the selected metric. 
The metric options are:
  1) Average word length
  2) Hapax Legomena count. A word is considered to be a Hapax Legomena if it only appears in the document once, so the metric is the      measurement of  unique words in the document.

To launch, either:
  1) Visit
  2) Download hw7.html, open a terminal, cd into the directory to where you downloaded hw7.html, launch a server (python -m http.server), and navigate to that port in your web browser's address bar.
